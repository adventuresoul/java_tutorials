// Packages are namespaces that organize classes and interfaces.
// Built-in packages (like java.lang, java.util) are provided by Java, whereas user-defined packages are created to organize your own code.
// Declaration: Use the package keyword at the top of your source file.
// Importing: Use the import statement or fully qualified names to use classes from other packages.
// Access Control: Packages help manage access levels through default (package-private), public, protected, and private modifiers.
// Compilation and Execution: Ensure your file structure reflects your package hierarchy, compile with javac, and run using fully qualified names.
